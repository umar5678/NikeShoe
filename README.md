# Nike Landing Page -- React + Tailwindcss
 "I am thrilled to share my latest accomplishment: the successful creation of Nike's landing page frontend. I embarked on this project after gaining valuable insights from the Javascript mastery tutorial. After grasping the fundamentals, I took it upon myself to apply what I learned and undertook the challenge of implementing navigation and mobile navigation. I am delighted to announce that the project is now completed and live, thanks to deployment on Vercel."

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
